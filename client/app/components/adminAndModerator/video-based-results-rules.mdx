1. For blindfolded events, your face must be visible during the entire solve (it must be visible that your mask is on
   during the solving phase).
2. The final time must be visible at the end of the video with no cuts after the end of the solve. If the video is sped
   up, the time must be visible throughout the entire attempt.
3. For team events, every participant must use a different scramble, be in the same place, not touch the puzzle while
   waiting for other participants (penalty: **+2**), and be visible on video at the same time (an exception can be made
   for team events with 5 or more participants). Penalty for an early start: **+2**.
4. If you're submitting a Mean of 3, there must be no cuts between the solves.
5. For 2x2x2, 3x3x3, 4x4x4, Square-1, and FTO puzzles, it must be visible that a new scramble was generated and applied.
   Scrambles must be generated with [cubing.js](https://experiments.cubing.net/cubing.js/mark3/),
   [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/), or [TNoodle](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/).
6. Results from other websites (e.g. the WCA) are not accepted.
