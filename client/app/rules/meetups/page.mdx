These rules only apply to meetups, and they supplement the general rules, with
some points being overridden.\
M1. Timers, stopwatches and other official equipment is not required. Mobile
devices may be used to time attempts.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M1.1. Inspection time rules still apply.\
M2. Judges and scramblers are not required.\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M2.1. Random state scrambles must still be used for
those events that have them available. For those that don't, random move
scrambles must be used. The scrambles must be generated ahead of time.\
M3. A meetup may not have fewer than three competitors in total. Such meetups
will be removed without the results being published.\
M4. A meetup may not be held at a private residence.\
M5. A meetup may be restricted to members of a particular group, at the
discretion of the admin team (e.g. speedcubing club members at a university, or
students of a specific school).\
M6. Meetup names and IDs may not include the word "open".
