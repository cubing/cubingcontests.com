1. The [WCA Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/full/) must be followed wherever applicable.
2. Judges and equipment (i.e. timers, stopwatches, sight blockers, etc.) are required for unofficial events at WCA
   competitions and for unofficial competitions.
3. Gen 2 timers are allowed in addition to the timers allowed for WCA competitions.
4. [cubing.js](https://experiments.cubing.net/cubing.js/mark3/), [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/), or
   [TNoodle](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/) scrambles must be used for twisty puzzle
   events. In particular, random-state scrambles must be used for a puzzle, if available.
5. Only organizers and Delegates of WCA competitions are allowed to hold unofficial events at them.
6. Every event has a ranked average format (i.e. Average of 5, Mean of 3). If a round uses a different average format,
   average results from that round will not be included in the rankings (but single results will).
7. The solved state for a non-WCA twisty puzzle is determined by each side having colored parts of the same color. If a
   puzzle has multiple solved states (e.g. Dino Cube), it may be solved into and scrambled from any of the possible
   solved states (scrambling orientation rules still apply).

#### Relay events

R1. The judge uncovers all puzzles at once.\
R2. An attempt includes a normal 15-second inspection phase, regardless of the number of puzzles. The competitor(s) is
free to inspect any of the puzzles in any order during this phase.

#### Team events

T1. There must be no physical contact with arms below the elbow between any members of a team during a solve
(specifically solve, not the full attempt). Penalty: **DNF**.\
T2. All members of a team may communicate with each other and with the judge.\
T3. A team must consist of the same members for all attempts across all rounds of an event. Exception: Some events may
have specific allowances for this.\
T4. A competitor who has participated in a round as a member of one team must not compete as a member of any other team
in that round.

#### Fully blindfolded events

F1. A fully blindfolded attempt proceeds like a normal blindfolded attempt (see
[Article B of the WCA Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/full#article-B-blindfolded)), with
the following changes:\
F2. There is no memorization phase.\
F3. The competitor must be blindfolded before the start of the attempt.\
F4. After the competitor dons the blindfold and tells the judge they are ready, the judge holds up the sight blocker
between the competitor's face and the puzzle, and tells the competitor they may start the attempt.\
F5. The competitor starts the attempt by starting the timer. This is the same as other events, except the competitor
starts the timer and lifts the puzzle cover while blindfolded, entirely by feel.
