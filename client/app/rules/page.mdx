1. The [WCA Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/full/)
   must be followed wherever applicable.
2. Judges and equipment (i.e. timers, stopwatches, sight blockers, etc.) are
   required for unofficial events at WCA competitions and for unofficial
   competitions.
3. Gen 2 timers are allowed in addition to the timers allowed for WCA
   competitions.
4. [cubing.js](https://experiments.cubing.net/cubing.js/mark3/),
   [csTimer](https://cstimer.net/), or
   [TNoodle](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/scrambles/)
   scrambles must be used for twisty puzzle events. In particular, random-state
   scrambles must be used for a puzzle, if available.
5. Only organizers and Delegates of WCA competitions are allowed to hold
   unofficial events at them.
6. Every event has a ranked average format (i.e. Average of 5, Mean of 3). If a
   round uses a different average format, average results from that round will
   not be included in the rankings (but single results will).
7. The solved state for a non-WCA twisty puzzle is determined by each side
   having colored parts of the same color. If a puzzle has multiple solved
   states (e.g. Dino Cube), it may be solved into and scrambled from any of the
   possible solved states (scrambling orientation rules still apply).
8. Contest names and IDs may not include the words "championship", "national",
   or "nationals".

#### Relay events

R1. The judge uncovers all puzzles at once.\
R2. An attempt includes a normal 15 second inspection phase for events with up to three puzzles. The competitor(s) is free to inspect any of the puzzles in
any order during this phase.\
  R2.1. Events with four or more puzzles have a 30 second inspection phase. The judge calls out "16 SECONDS" and "24 SECONDS" during the inspection phase.

#### Team events

T1. There must be no physical contact with arms below the elbow between any
members of a team during a solve (specifically solve, not the full attempt).
Penalty: **DNF**.\
T2. All members of a team may communicate with each other and with the judge.\
T3. A team must consist of the same members for all attempts across all rounds
of an event. Exception: Some events may have specific allowances for this.\
T4. A competitor who has participated in a round as a member of one team must
not compete as a member of any other team in that round.

#### Fully blindfolded events

F1. A fully blindfolded attempt proceeds like a normal blindfolded attempt (see
[Article B of the WCA Regulations](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/full#article-B-blindfolded)),
with the following changes:\
F2. There is no memorization phase.\
F3. The competitor must be blindfolded before the start of the attempt.\
F4. After the competitor dons the blindfold and tells the judge they are ready,
the judge holds up the sight blocker between the competitor's face and the
puzzle, and tells the competitor they may start the attempt.\
F5. The competitor starts the attempt by starting the timer. This is the same as
other events, except the competitor starts the timer and lifts the puzzle cover
while blindfolded, entirely by feel.
