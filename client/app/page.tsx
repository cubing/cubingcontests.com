        competitions, speedcuber meetups, and other unofficial events.

        The events are split up into multiple categories: Unofficial, WCA, Extreme BLD, and Miscellaneous. Extreme BLD
        events are not meant to be done in a competition-like setting, but instead need to be submitted individually
        with video evidence. Some other events also allow submitted results.

      <h3 className="cc-basic-heading">Holding a contest</h3>
      <p>
        Cubing Contests is an open platform where anyone can hold their competitions and meetups. However, you must
        first be granted moderator access to be able to create new contests. If you would like to hold unofficial events
        at a WCA competition or create an unofficial competition or meetup, you must first read the moderator
        instructions.

        Please note that an unofficial competition can only be hosted on Cubing Contests if it's infeasible for it to be
        held as an official <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/" target="_blank">WCA</a> competition.
